# Percepio Demo Library (work in progress)
A collection of demos for Percepio Tracealyzer and Percepio Detect

## 01_tracerecorder_kernel_tracing.c
Demonstrates TraceRecorder tracing with FreeRTOS. The demo runs a small FreeRTOS application for a few seconds. Halt the debugger at any time to save a snapshot trace.

### Capturing trace snapshots with GDB
* Open the debug console in your IDE during a debug session, or launch a gdb session from the command line.
* Halt the execution sometime after the xTraceEnable call (e.g. at a breakpoint).
  - If using an Eclipse-based IDE, or using gdb from the command line, run the following command:
  ```
  dump binary value trace.bin *RecorderDataPtr
  ```
  - If using VS Code, you need to add ‘-exec’ before the gdb command, like this:
  ```
  -exec dump binary value trace.bin *RecorderDataPtr
  ```
* The resulting "trace.bin" is typically found in the project folder. Open trace.bin in your Tracealyzer application by selecting ‘File –> Open –> Open File’ or, if using Windows, you can drag and drop the file to your Tracealyzer application.

* For more frequent use, you can configure your Tracealyzer application to automate the GDB trace capture, using the “Take Snapshot” option. For setup instructions, see “Using the Tracealyzer GDB integration” at https://percepio.com/tracealyzer/gettingstarted/snapshots-eclipse-gdb/.

### Capturing trace snapshots with IAR Embedded Workbench
Locate `save_trace_buffer.mac` in the EWARM project folder. This IAR macro file will save the contents of the trace buffer to a host file.

* Add the macro file under Options -> Debugger -> Use Macro File(s).
* When in a debug session, open View -> Macros -> Debugger Macros and look for “save_trace_buffer”.
  - In the “Debugger Macros” view, right-click on your macro and select “Add to Quicklaunch window”. 
  - Double-click on the “refresh” icon in the Quicklaunch window to save the trace.
