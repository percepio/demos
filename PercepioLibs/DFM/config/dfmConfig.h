/* When using ITM logging over STLINK v2 together with IAR Embedded Workbench,
   the last ~2 KB of data is sometimes not emitted to the log file until more
   data is written. It seems there is some buffer that isn't always flushed.
   
   As a workaround, use vDfmCloudPortFlushWithDummyData to emit 2 KB of dummy
   data after each alert to ensure all DFM data is written to the ITM log file. 
   This extra data in between the DFM alerts is ignored by the bin2alerts script
   so is not ingested by Percepio Detect.

   This issues seems to be specific for STLINK probes. IAR i-jet probes does not
   seem to have this issue and has worked fine without the flushing in our tests.   
   So if using an i-jet, you may remove the lines below to skip the flushing.
